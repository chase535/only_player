<summary>📖 <strong>Feature Guide</strong></summary>

### Media Library

- Browse videos in folder mode, tree mode, or flat video mode
- Search media from the library screen
- Switch list and grid layouts
- Sort by title, duration, size, date, and related view options
- Exclude selected folders from scanning
- Optionally ignore `.nomedia` and include those directories in scanning
- Refresh and verify media behavior faster with debug-only commands

### Playback

- Play local videos directly from the library or external intents
- Continue playback from the previous position
- Autoplay the next video in the current folder
- Use Picture in Picture mode
- Keep background playback behavior configurable
- Adjust playback speed, long-press speed, zoom, and content scale
- Use seek, brightness, volume, zoom, and double-tap gestures
- Remember per-file selections like audio track and subtitle track

### Subtitle and Audio

- Select built-in audio tracks and subtitle tracks
- Load external subtitle files from the system document picker
- Render ASS subtitles with effect support
- Configure preferred audio language and subtitle language
- Change subtitle font, bold text, text size, background, delay, speed, and text encoding
- Control decoder preferences for audio and video playback behavior

### Personalization and Settings

- Switch app language inside the app
- Use Material 3 and dynamic color theming
- Configure gestures, player controls, orientation, decoder priority, and thumbnails
- Back up app settings and player settings to a file
- Restore settings from a backup file
- Reset settings when needed

### Release and Debugging

- CI produces debug artifacts for branch validation
- Release workflow validates signing secrets before signed builds

<summary>📱 <strong>User Manual</strong></summary>

### 1. First Launch

- Install a debug or release APK
- Grant media access permission when prompted
- If you enable `.nomedia` override, also grant all-files access when Android asks for it

### 2. Browse Your Library

- Open the home screen and choose folder, tree, or video view
- Use search to find files quickly
- Open quick settings from the media screen to change sorting, layout, and view mode
- Hide folders you do not want to see from settings

### 3. Watch Videos

- Tap any video to open the player
- Swipe horizontally to seek
- Swipe vertically to control brightness or volume
- Double tap to trigger the configured skip action
- Pinch to zoom if zoom gestures are enabled
- Use PiP or background play if your settings allow it

### 4. Use Subtitles

- Open subtitle track selection inside the player for embedded tracks
- Use the subtitle picker to load an external subtitle file
- ASS subtitles support effect rendering, not only plain text display
- Fine-tune subtitle appearance and playback behavior from Settings > Subtitle

### 5. Back Up and Restore

- Open Settings > General
- Export current app and player settings to a backup file
- Import the backup later on the same or another device
- Use reset if you want a clean configuration again

### 6. Troubleshooting

- If the library looks incomplete, check folder exclusions and `.nomedia` behavior
- If playback fails, retry after granting media permissions again
- If subtitle appearance looks wrong, verify text encoding and ASS track selection
- If a signed release fails in CI, check the signing validation output first

<summary>🔧 <strong>Build and Validation</strong></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio or Android SDK command-line tools
- JDK `25`

### Common Commands

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew test
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
./gradlew ktlintCheck test assembleDebug --warning-mode=fail
```

<summary>🧑‍💻 <strong>Development Tutorial</strong></summary>

### Step 1: Clone and Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kindness-Kismet/only_player.git
cd only_player
```

Open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and confirm JDK 25 is selected.

### Step 2: Build a Debug APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Install one of these outputs:

- `build/apk/Only-Player-debug-arm64-v8a-<version>.apk`
- `build/apk/Only-Player-debug-x86_64-<version>.apk`

### Step 3: Navigate the Codebase

Recommended reading order:

1. `README.md`
2. `app/src/main/java/one/only/player/MainActivity.kt`
3. `feature/videopicker/`
4. `feature/player/`
5. `feature/settings/`
6. `core/` modules for data, media, and shared UI

### Step 4: Add or Change a Feature

A typical flow is:

1. Add or adjust models in `core/model`
2. Update repositories or persistence in `core/data`, `core/database`, or `core/datastore`
3. Add use-case logic in `core/domain` when needed
4. Wire UI in the relevant `feature/*` module
5. Verify strings and localization in `core/ui/src/main/res`

### Step 5: Validate Before Commit

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck test assembleDebug --warning-mode=fail
```

If the change touches player behavior, also run the app on a device or emulator and verify actual playback.

### Step 6: Prepare a Release

1. Update `app/build.gradle.kts` with the target version
2. Push a `release/vx.y.z` branch or run the release workflow manually
3. Let CI validate signing and build artifacts
4. Review generated GitHub Release notes
